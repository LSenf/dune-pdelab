PDELab
======

This is version 2.0.0-rc1 of the PDELab library.

PDELab[0] is a PDE solver toolbox built on top of DUNE, the Distributed and Unified
Numerics Environment [1].

The main intention is to provide a good set of high-level abstractions to allow
for a reasonably quick development of simulation codes, while at the same time
offering the flexibility to implement new numerical methods and optimize for
specific simulation scenarios.

This package contains the PDELab library code. For application examples see the
companion package dune-pdelab-howto.

If you have downloaded a release tarball, you can find the autogenerated Doxygen
API documentation in doc/doxygen/html. Otherwise, you can build this documentation
yourself by calling "make doc". Note that you need Doxygen and GraphViz available at
configure time to be able to build the documentation.

If you need help, please ask on our mailinglist [8]. Bugs can also be submitted
to the PDELab bugtracker at [9] instead.

Dependencies
------------

PDELab depends on the following software packages:

* DUNE core libraries (dune-common, dune-geometry, dune-grid, dune-istl,
  dune-localfunctions) version 2.3.1+, and their respective dependencies. As
  of now, version 2.3.1 of the core modules has not been released yet, so you
  will have to check out the branch releases/2.0. Using the 2.3.0 release WILL
  NOT WORK due to a number of critical bugs in that version!

* The dune-typetree library, version 2.3.x, which you can obtain from [10].

* PDELab's compiler requirements differ slightly from the underlying DUNE
  libraries: We require at least GCC 4.0, although we only regurlarly test GCC
  versions from GCC 4.2 onward. Compile times are greatly reduced if the
  compiler supports the new C++11 standard (GCC 4.3 and newer). PDELab is not
  regularly tested with ICC, but we also support the clang compiler (3.1+).

The following software is optional

* PETSc 3.3 [5] - there is an experimental backend for PETSc vectors and
  matrices. See RELEASE_NOTES for details. WARNING: The PETSC backend is
  currently broken.

* Eigen 3.1.0 [6] - there is an experimental backend for Eigen vectors and
  matrices as well as some solvers. See RELEASE_NOTES for details.

For a full explanation of the DUNE installation process please read
the installation notes [2] or the build system HOWTO [3].
