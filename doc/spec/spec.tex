\section{Notes}

\begin{enumerate}[1)]
\item \textbf{19.01.09}: Can we implement the type trees in seperate
  class templates? The
  same construction is used in global fields, local fields and grid
  functions. Moreover a mechanism checking the same structure of trees
  would be quite useful. Yes we should do that!
\item \textbf{19.01.09}: Should the LocalSingleField export an entity
  reference, or better an EntitiyGeometry? 
  This would parallel the global field that exports a grid
  view reference.
\item \textbf{19.01.09}: Don't forget about time-dependent functions
  and constraints.
\item \textbf{19.01.09}: Introduce namespace PDELab within Dune?
\end{enumerate}

\end{enumerate}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{GlobalSingleField}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsubsection{Synopsis}

Provides all information about a finite element space, i.e. local
basis functions, local to global map of indices, dimension.
This type is the basis for bottom up construction of multi-field
function spaces.


\subsubsection{Template Parameter}

\begin{enumerate}[1)]
\item Type implementing LocalFiniteElementMapInterface. This
  type provides the local finite element (a type defined in
  \lstinline|dune-localfunctions|). 
\item Type that is a model of GridView interface (a type exported
  by \lstinline|dune-grid|). 
\item Type implementing VectorBackendInterface.
\item Type allowing the selection of restricted mode where the number
  of degrees of freedom per entity depends only on the
  codimension. This template parameter might be given a default value.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Derived From}

\begin{enumerate}[1)]
\item GlobalSingleFieldInterface
\item ReferenceCountable
\end{enumerate}


\subsubsection{Enums}

\begin{enumerate}[1)]
\item isSingle = true : allows to determine end of recursion in
  template metaprograms for multi-field finite element spaces.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Exported Types}

\begin{enumerate}[1)]
\item GridViewType
\item BackendType
\item SizeType, a shortcut for BackendType::SizeType
\item IndexType, a shortcut for BackendType::IndexType
\item LocalFieldType parametrized with the GlobalSingleField (i.e. itself)
\item template$<$typename E$>$ VectorContainer::Type exports the type of a Vector
  (defined in the backend) where each element is of type E.
\item LocalFiniteElementMapType
\item CoefficientType. This is the RangeFieldType from the local finite element.
\item RowType = std::map$<$IndexType,CoefficientType$>$.
\item TransformationType = std::map$<$IndexType,RowType$>$. Type to
  represent the basis transformation in the
  constraints. Transformation works as follows:

  The unconstrained space is defined by a basis
  $\Phi=\{\phi_j\,:\,j\in J\}$. The constrained space is characterized
  by the basis $\tilde\Phi=\{\tilde\phi_j\,:\,j\in \tilde{J}\}$ where
  $\tilde{J}\subseteq J$ and $\bar{J}=J\setminus\tilde{J}$ are the
  constrained indices. Thus $J$ is partitioned into $J =
  \tilde{J}\cup\bar{J}$. 

  The new basis functions $\tilde{\phi}_j$ are constructed as linear
  combinations from old basis functions via
  \begin{equation}
    j\in\tilde{J} \quad : \quad \tilde\phi_j = \phi_j +
    \sum_{k\in\bar{J}} (S^T)_{jk} \phi_k.
  \end{equation} 
  where the $S\in\mathbb{R}^{\bar{J}\times\tilde{J}}$ is a sparse,
  rectangular matrix. 
  Note that only combinations with basis functions from the
  constrained nodes are allowed. Introducing the finite element
  isomorphisms we have
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
FE_{\tilde\Phi}(x) &= \sum_{j\in\tilde{J}} x_j \tilde\phi_j = 
\sum_{j\in\tilde{J}} x_j\left(\phi_j +
    \sum_{k\in\bar{J}} (S^T)_{jk} \phi_k\right)\\
&= \sum_{j\in\tilde{J}} x_j\phi_j + \sum_{k\in\bar{J}} \left(
    \sum_{j\in\tilde{J}} (S)_{kj} x_j\right) \phi_k \\
&= FE_{\Phi}(\tilde{R}^T x) + FE_{\Phi}(\bar{R}^TS\tilde{R}x )\\
&= FE_{\Phi}(\tilde{R}^T x + \bar{R}^TS\tilde{R}x)
\end{split}
\end{equation}
\end{enumerate}
where the restriction matrices are rectangular matrices $\tilde{R} :
\mathbb{R}^J \to \mathbb{R}^{\tilde{J}}$ and $\bar{R} :
\mathbb{R}^J \to \mathbb{R}^{\bar{J}}$ given by
\begin{align}
j\in\tilde{J} \,:\, (\tilde{R}x)_j &= x_j &
j\in\bar{J} \,:\, (\bar{R}x)_j &= x_j.
\end{align}

The TransformationType stores both the sparse matrix $S$ in a row-wise
fashion and the constrained
index set $\bar{J}$. If the TransformationType object (which is a map)
contains an entry for the index $j$, then we have $j\in\bar{J}$. It
it is also allowed that a row of $S$ is contains only zeroes. In that
case an empty RowType object is stored for that row. This corresponds
to Dirichlet constraints. For hanging nodes or other types of
constraints (e.g. functions with zero mean) non-empty rows are stored. 

\subsubsection{Methods}

\begin{enumerate}[1)]
\item Constructor(GridViewType\&, LocalFiniteElementMapType\&) : store
  references to grid view and local finite element map. The latter
  will be reference counted.
\item GridViewType\& gridView(). Return the grid view 
  the field is built upon.
\item SizeType globalSize(). Return the size (dimension) of the
  finite element space.  
\item SizeType maxLocalSize(). Return the maximum size (number of
  coefficients) of the local finite element space at any entity of the
  grid view.
\item IndexType upMap(IndexType). This is the identity here. Maps
  indices from this field to a global field.
\item globalIndices(const LocalFiniteElementType\&, std::vector$<$IndexType$>$\&).
  Determine the global indices of the
  coefficients at the given entity. This method is normally used by a
  LocalSingleFieldType object.
\item LocalFiniteElementMapType\& localFiniteElementMap(). Retrieves
  the map from entity to local finite element.
\item const TransformationType\& transformation(). Access to
  coefficients of basis transformation used to implement the constraints.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Hints}

\begin{enumerate}[1)]
\item A pointer to the LocalFiniteElementMap object must be
  stored. Use reference counting with  
\end{enumerate}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{LocalFiniteElementMapInterface}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsubsection{Synopsis}

Models of this type provide a local finite element for a given
entity. 

\subsubsection{Template Parameter}

\begin{enumerate}[1)]
\item T1 : a type providing the typ체es to be exported.
\item T2 : a type providing the implementation to be called in
  Barton-Nackman style.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Exported Types}

\begin{enumerate}[1)]
\item LocalFiniteElementType
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Methods}

\begin{enumerate}[1)]
\item template$<$E$>$ const LocalFiniteElementType\& find (const E\&)
  : return local finite element for the given entity.
\end{enumerate}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{ConstrainedGlobalSingleField}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsubsection{Synopsis}

Proxy class that uses a GlobalSingleField object and extends it by
constraints. 

We still have to define how exactly the callback works.

\subsubsection{Template Parameter}

\begin{enumerate}[1)]
\item T1 = a type implementing the GlobalSingleFieldInterface.
\item T2 = a type containing callbacks to assemble the constraints.
\end{enumerate}

This type copies the interface from T1 and uses a reference to a T1
object to implement it. 

\subsubsection{Derived From}

\begin{enumerate}[1)]
\item GlobalSingleFieldInterface
\item ReferenceCountable
\end{enumerate}


\subsubsection{Methods}

\begin{enumerate}[1)]
\item Constructor(T1\&, T2\&) : store references to underlying global
  field and construction callback.
\item const TransformationType\& transformation(). This method
  overwrites the method with the same name from the base class
\end{enumerate}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{ConstraintCreationInterface}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsubsection{Synopsis}

A model of this type has to be provided in
ConstrainedGlobalSingleField to set up the constraints.
Barton-Nackman style 

\subsubsection{Template Parameter}

\begin{enumerate}[1)]
\item T1 : type traits
\item T2 : implementation.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Enums}

\begin{enumerate}[1)]
\item A number specifiying which terms (volume, boundary, skeleton)
  are present in the implementation. This allows the caller to remove
  unnecessary calls at compile time.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Exported Types}

\begin{enumerate}[1)]
\item CoefficientType. This is the RangeFieldType from the local finite element.
\item RowType = std::map$<$IndexType,CoefficientType$>$.
\item TransformationType = std::map$<$IndexType,RowType$>$. Type to
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Methods}

\begin{enumerate}[1)]
\item template$<$EG,LF$>$ void constraintsVolume (EG\&,
  LF\&, TransformationType\&) : add constraints for an element. EG is
  a model of ElementGeometryInterface.
\item template$<$IG,LF$>$ void constraintsBoundary (EG\&,
  LF\&, TransformationType\&) : add constraints for boundary
  intersection. IG is a model of IntersectionGeometryInterface.
\item template$<$IG,LF$>$ void constraintsSkeleton (IG\&,
  LF\&, LF\&, TransformationType\&) : add constraints for an
  interior intersection. IG is a model of IntersectionGeometryInterface.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Hints}

Implementations will be parametrized with a hierarchic function where
the user provides boundary conditions. Thus the specific way how
e.g. a Dirichlet boundary condition is specified is left to the
implementation. 


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{ElementGeometryInterface}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsubsection{Synopsis}

Type providing geometry of a codim 0 entity.



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{IntersectionGeometryInterface}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{GlobalPowerField}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsubsection{Synopsis}

Collects a compile-time given number of fields of identical type (although there might
be different objects) into a multi-field finite element space. 
Multi-field finite element spaces are represented by a tree.

All subfields must have the same GridViewType since a finite element
space is constructed for a single grid view.

\subsubsection{Template Parameter}

\begin{enumerate}[1)]
\item typename T1 = Type implementing GlobalFieldInterface, i.e. we may combine any type
  of finite element space.
\item integer ncomp specifying number of components.
\item Type allowing the selection of blockwise or lexicographic
  ordering. Lexicographic might be the default as it is always possible.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Derived From}

\begin{enumerate}[1)]
\item MultiFieldInterface
\item ReferenceCountable
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Enums}

\begin{enumerate}[1)]
\item isSingle = false : allows to determine end of recursion in
  template metaprograms for multi-field finite element spaces.
\item COMP = ncomp. Export number of components for template
  metaprograms recurring over the type tree.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Exported Types}

\begin{enumerate}[1)]
\item GridViewType 
\item BackendType
\item SizeType, a shortcut for BackendType::SizeType
\item IndexType, a shortcut for BackendType::IndexType
\item LocalFieldType parametrized with the GlobalPowerField (i.e. itself)
\item template$<$typename E$>$ VectorContainer::Type exports the type of a Vector
  (defined in the backend) where each element is of type E.
\item template$<$int k$>$ struct SubField::Type exports the type of
  the k'th component
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Methods}

\begin{enumerate}[1)]
\item Constructor(T1\&) : identical field is used for all the components. 
\item Constructor(T1\&, \ldots , T1\&) : ncomp fields of the same type
\item GridViewType\& gridView(). Return the grid view 
  the field is built upon. It is ensured that all components are built
  on the same grid view object.
\item SizeType globalSize(). Return the size (dimension) of the
  composite finite element space.  
\item SizeType maxLocalSize(). Return the maximum size (number of
  coefficients) of the local composite finite element space at any entity of the
  grid view.
\item IndexType upMap(IndexType). This is the identity here. Maps
  indices from this field to a global field.
\item SubField$<$k$>$::Type\& subField$<$k$>$(). Get the k'th component.
\item IndexType subMap$<$k$>$(IndexType). Map index from the global
  index set of component k to the global index set of the composite space.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Hints}

In the power field the types of all components are the same. This does
not mean that all components must have the same size! Blockwise
ordering is only possible if all components do have the same size,
otherwise only lexicographic ordering is possible.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{GlobalCompositeField}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsubsection{Synopsis}

Collects a compile-time given number of fields of different types into
a multi-field finite element space. 
Multi-field finite element spaces are represented by a tree.

All subfields must have the same GridViewType since a finite element
space is constructed for a single grid view.

\subsubsection{Template Parameter}

\begin{enumerate}[1)]
\item typename T1,\ldots,Tk = Types implementing FieldInterface, 
i.e. we may combine any type of finite element space. 
\item Type allowing the selection of blockwise or lexicographic
  ordering. Lexicographic might be the default as it is always possible.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Derived From}

\begin{enumerate}[1)]
\item MultiFieldInterface
\item ReferenceCountable
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Enums}

\begin{enumerate}[1)]
\item isSingle = false : allows to determine end of recursion in
  template metaprograms for multi-field finite element spaces.
\item COMP. Export number of components for template
  metaprograms recurring over the type tree.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Exported Types}

\begin{enumerate}[1)]
\item GridViewType 
\item BackendType
\item SizeType, a shortcut for BackendType::SizeType
\item IndexType, a shortcut for BackendType::IndexType
\item LocalFieldType parametrized with the GlobalPowerField (i.e. itself)
\item template$<$typename E$>$ VectorContainer::Type exports the type of a Vector
  (defined in the backend) where each element is of type E.
\item template$<$int k$>$ struct SubField::Type exports the type of
  the k'th component
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Methods}

\begin{enumerate}[1)]
\item Constructor(T1\&, \ldots , Tk\&) : Store all the subfields.
\item GridViewType\& gridView(). Return the grid view 
  the field is built upon. It is ensured that all components are built
  on the same grid view object.
\item SizeType globalSize(). Return the size (dimension) of the
  composite finite element space.  
\item SizeType maxLocalSize(). Return the maximum size (number of
  coefficients) of the local composite finite element space at any entity of the
  grid view.
\item IndexType upMap(IndexType). This is the identity here. Maps
  indices from this field to a global field.
\item SubField$<$k$>$::Type\& subField$<$k$>$(). Get the k'th component.
\item IndexType subMap$<$k$>$(IndexType). Map index from the global
  index set of component k to the global index set of the composite space.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Hints}

In the composite field the types of all components might be different,
due to compiler limitations the number of components is limited to
9. Naturally the size of the components is usually different. Blockwise
ordering is only possible if all components do have the same size,
otherwise only lexicographic ordering is possible.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{GlobalSubField}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsubsection{Synopsis}

Allows to select a descendent of a given node in the multi-field
tree. Provides upward mapping of indices.

Idea (to be deleted) : Gets a multi-field and an integer k as template
parameter. Derives from the k'th component of the multi-field and
overwrites the globalSize() method and the upMap() method. This should
be it. As GlobalSubField is derived from the destination field the
LocalField can be used as before. Do we need upMap and globalSize
virtual to ensure that the LocalField uses the right methods?

What happens when this field is used as a component in a
power/composite field which is perfectly allowed!
